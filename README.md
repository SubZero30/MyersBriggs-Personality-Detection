### MBTI Personality Detection
<ul>
<li> This repository is a prototype of my senior year engg project. </li>
<li> The dataset used for training covers books originating from 5 major personality types of the total 16 MBTI types which account for more than 80% of the population. </li>
<li> The objective of this project is to predict the personality type of the user into either of the 5 types by parsing the text written by the user. </li>
<li> It covers pre-processing, word-2-vec conversion, training model and model inferencing. </li>
</ul>

For requirements:
> pip install -r req.txt

<ul>
<li> Create venv; install req </li>
<li> Input your text to be predicted into a type in test.txt </li>
<li> Run project_run.py </li>
</ul>
